        Algorithm for Simple Calculator
        1. Start
     
        2. Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in x.
   
        3. Prompt the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and store it in operator.

        4. Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in y.
    
        5. Check the operator:
   
            If the operator is \"+\", compute result = x + y.
    
            If the operator is \"-\", compute result = x - y.
     
            If the operator is \"*\", compute result = x * y.
    
            If the operator is \"/\":
     
                If y â‰  0, compute result = x / y.
      
                Else, display \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\" and stop.
    
            If the operator is not one of the above, display \"Error: Invalid operator\" and stop.
  
        6. If a valid operation is performed, display the result in the form:
            x operator y = result.
       
        7. End
